D3 deals best with two formats: GeoJson(link) and TopoJson(link)

We'll get an example from Mike: [http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4090848](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4090848)

He has the state and county geometry here: [http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/raw/4090846/us.json](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/raw/4090846/us.json)

We have states, and we have data. Let's draw a map!
