## Get some Geometry

***

* D3 deals best with two formats: GeoJson [(link)](http://geojson.org/) and TopoJson [(link)](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wik://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki)

* We'll get an example from Mike: [http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4090848](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4090848)

  He has the state and county geometry in TopoJson here: [http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/raw/4090846/us.json](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/raw/4090846/us.json)

We have states, and we have data. Let's draw a map!
