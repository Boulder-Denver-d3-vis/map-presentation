## Types of maps

***

* Most maps are intended to show geography, but *thematic maps* attach extra information to the display.

* The first thematic map was created by Jocodus Hondius in 1607.

* It is called __Designatio Orbis Cristiani__ and shows how major religions were spread around the known world.
