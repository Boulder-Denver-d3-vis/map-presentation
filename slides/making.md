## Let's make a map!

***

We'll use D3 and make a simple chloropleth map.

* Step 1: find some data.

  We'll use Census Bureau educational attainment by state: [Census link](https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/education/educational_attainment.html)

  From this, we have education completion (High School, Bachelor's, Advanced) in 6 different years, by state.

* Step 2: convert to CSV (or some other useable format) and clean it up.

  [Here's the CSV.](data/education.csv)
